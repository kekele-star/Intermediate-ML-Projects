ðŸ”Ž Fraud Detection with Machine Learning

Overview

This repository contains code and resources for building a machine learning model to detect fraudulent transactions. 
Fraud detection is a critical problem in various industries, especially in finance, where identifying and preventing fraudulent activities is crucial to maintaining security and trust.

1. Introduction

Fraudulent activities cost businesses and individuals millions each year. This project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to automatically identify and flag potential instances of fraud in transactions. The model is trained on historical data, learning patterns and anomalies to predict the likelihood of a transaction being fraudulent.

2. Setup

Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python (version 3.10)
- Jupyter Notebook (for running the code)

Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kekele-star/fraud-detection-system.git
cd fraud-detection-system
```

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Data

The dataset used for this project contains transactional information with labeled instances of fraud and non-fraud transactions. The dataset is not included in this repository due to its size but can be obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud.

4. Modeling

The `modeling.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook contains the code for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. Various machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Gradient Boosting were experimented with to find the best-performing model.

5. Evaluation

The model's performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, are discussed in the notebook. Visualizations and insights regarding model performance and feature importance are also included.
